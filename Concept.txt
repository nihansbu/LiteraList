LiteraList

Overview
LiteraList is a web application that allows users to manage their personal library of books. Users can search for books, add them to their personal library, rate them, and write their thoughts. The application leverages the Google Books API for book search and MongoDB for data persistence.

Features
Book Search: Users can search for books by title, author, or ISBN. The search functionality uses the Google Books API.

Personal Library: Users can add books from the search results to their personal library. Each book in the library is displayed with its cover, title, author, a short description, and a link to more information on Google Books.

User Annotations: Users can add their own notes to each book in their library. They can rate the book, write a review, and add tags.

Library Management: Users can organize their library by creating custom categories or shelves (e.g., "Read", "Want to Read", "Favorites").

User Authentication: Users can create their own account and manage their personal library independently.
